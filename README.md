# Camera Calibration

The purpose of this assignment is to implement a function to calibrate a camera.

The input should be chessboard images taken from different camera poses with the same camera.

After extracting the chessboard corners and setting up the coordinate origin, then estimating the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the extrinsic matrixs of every camera pose of images. Finally, we use the intrinsic matrix and the extrinsic matrixes to plot them as 3D results.


for the implemetation detail, please refer to the report.
